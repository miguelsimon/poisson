    "There's a lot of recent literature on adding sparsity constraints to Poisson reconstruction problems; after reading some of them and considering implementation complexity and my capacity to understand what the different sparse priors are actually optimizing for, I've settled for the approach in [Yin, P., Lou, Y., He, Q., & Xin, J. (2015). Minimization of â„“1-2 for Compressed Sensing. SIAM J. Scientific Computing, 37.](https://www.math.uci.edu/~jxin/cam14-01.pdf).\n",
